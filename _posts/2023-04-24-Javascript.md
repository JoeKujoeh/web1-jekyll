Javascript is one of the primary languages for websites, along with Html and CSS. If Html makes up the structure and CSS the design, you can say that Javascript makes up the functionality of the website. Simple animations can be achieved with the help of CSS, but generally it is Javascript that enables everything that "happens" on a web page. Examples of things that happen could be that something changes when you click a button, that a form shows that I have filled in my social security number in the wrong format, or that something moves or changes on the website. A common use for Javascript is to decide what should happen when a user interacts in different ways on a website. This is called using "event listeners". For example, you can listen for a user to scroll, click the enter key, or start filling out a form, and decide what should happen when the listener hears these things.
