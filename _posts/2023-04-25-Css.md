Cascading Style Sheets or CSS for short is one of the primary languages for websites, along with Html and Javascript. Css controls the design of the website , and therefore takes care of everything that has to do with visual effects. With the help of CSS you can make the website look however you want. With everything from choosing fonts for text to making nice animations. To be able to use CSS, you first need Html as a structure. Namely the CSS code points out Html elements in order to be able to choose what you want to apply a certain design to.
