HyperText Markup Language or Html for short is one of the primary languages for websites, along with Html and Javascript. Html sets the structure of all websites in the form of headers, paragraphs and distinguishing certain content from each other. You can also insert images with Html. To be able to make all headings on a web page red, a structure is needed in the HTML code that makes it possible to distinguish the headings from other content. The same is true with functionality. In order to make a pop-up window appear when you click a button on a web page, that button needs to be marked out in the HTML code.
